        <h2>WEB is</h2>
        <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources
            are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by
            hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the WWW are transfered via the Hypertext Transfer
            Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a
            software application called a web server.
